# Anomaly-Detection
### What is Anomaly Detection?
Anomaly detection is a process for identifying unexpected data, event or behavior that require some examination. It is a well-established field within data science and there is a large number of algorithms to detect anomalies in a dataset depending on data type and business context. 

### Techniques Used:
1. [Z-score with Artificial Neural Network]()

**What is Z-score?**

Simply speaking, Z-score is a statistical measure that tells you how far is a data point from the rest of the dataset. In a more technical term, Z-score tells how many standard deviations away a given observation is from the mean.
For example, a Z score of 2.5 means that the data point is 2.5 standard deviation far from the mean. And since it is far from the center, itâ€™s flagged as an outlier/anomaly.

### Data Used:
Step 0: You can understand about the data from the offical page of [KDD Cup 1999](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html)
Step 1: Download the data from [KDD Cup 1999 Data HERE!!!](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup.data_10_percent.gz)
Step 2: Add the columns to the dataset, as there are two different files for that available on the same page.
Step 3: Save the dataset as a CSV file to use it.



**Note:** This repository is under updation, more methods will be added soon.
